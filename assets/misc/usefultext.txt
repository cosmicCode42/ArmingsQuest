README STUFF

## UX

### Project Goals
The primary goals of the site are to provide information about the characters in the party in a pleasing and easy-to-understand manner. Intended audience: myself and my friends, as well as other people that might be interested in following our group's adventures.

#### User Goals

User goals are:
- An easy to navigate site.
- Informative character pages.
- Diverse media to supplement character information.

### User Stories
As a user of this site, I want:
- A site and interface that is intuitive, convenient and easy to navigate.
- Information that is easy to find and understand, and laid out in a pleasing manner.
- Additional media (such as character portraits) to give me a better idea of the characters.

### Design Choices

#### **Interface**

I went with a simple navbar at the top and clickable character icons that lead to the character pages; the icons light up slightly when the mouse hovers over them (using ``:hover`` and ``opacity`` in CSS).

The navbar also remains fixed to the top of the screen, reducing scrolling required to return home or go to another character page. While this is subjective, I believe the contrast in colours I have chosen looks good, and the information is all clearly laid out.

#### **Colours**

The background colour (``rgba(255, 235, 205, 0.6)``) and black text for the main body was chosen for its simplicity and resemblance to yellowed paper or parchment. The header and footer use firebrick red (``#b22222``) as a background colour and off-white (``#fafafa``) text, for a pleasing contrast.

#### **Images**

I made use of character images to give a clear idea of each character's appearance...

... as well as progress bars to show the character's comparative strengths in several areas (known as 'stats').

The hero image, icons, and each of the character images are taken from a commissioned art piece made of the characters in question.

## Testing (Bugfixes go under here)

The site has been tested extensively to ensure the best user experience across multiple screen sizes.

- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

The developer used **W3C CSS Validation Service** and **W3C Markup Validation Service** to check the validity of the website code.

### Testing Process

In order to make sure the site renders acceptably across several screen sizes, I made liberal use of the DevTools offered by Google Chrome (or in my case, the Opera GX browser that closely mimics Chrome) as well as testing load times of each page, mobile and desktop, with the Lighthouse Chrome extension.

### User Stories Testing

As a user of the site, I want: 
- A site and interface that is intuitive, convenient and easy to navigate.
	- Test that all links lead to the proper places (character icons link to correct character pages, as do navbar links).
	- Test that the character icons lighten when the mouse hovers over them.
	- Ensure that the fixed-top navbar isn't clipping down into the main sections in its default position.
- Information that is easy to find and understand, and laid out in a pleasing manner.
	- Ensure that the images and text look acceptable and are spaced well on variable screen sizes.
	- Ensure that all content is centred in easily identifiable sections.
- Additional media (such as character portraits) to give me a better idea of the characters.
	- Test that character images are positioned well on variables screen sizes.
	- Test that stat bars are positioned well on variable screen sizes.
